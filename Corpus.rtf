{\*\generator Msftedit 5.41.21.2510;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\lang9\f0\fs22 Richard W. Lock , retired vice president and treasurer of\par
Owens-Illinois Inc. , was named a director of this transportation\par
industry supplier , increasing its board to six members .  John\par
J. Phelan Jr. , chairman of the Big Board , asserts that `` 1988 and\par
1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40\par
years . ''  In January , American Medical brought in a new chief\par
executive officer , Richard A. Gilleland , 45 , who will remain as\par
chairman , president and chief executive .  Ralph T. Linsley , vice\par
chairman of Eagle , will become vice chairman of Webster\\/Eagle .\par
Orkem declined to give details of its offer , saying only that the bid\par
will be submitted for approval by the board of the British company .\par
But in 1935 , when Congress was trying to find someone or something to\par
blame for the Great Depression , it decided to drop both the secretary\par
and the comptroller from the board .  Treasury Undersecretary David\par
Mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in\par
Hot Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there\par
through the following day .  He will remain chairman .  The memo\par
attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the\par
agency , which pleaded innocent to the charges .  J. Michael Cook ,\par
chairman of Deloitte , Haskins & Sells International , said he\par
believes the legal action by the British firm `` to be without merit\par
. ''  Other conservatives thought to be on the administration 's short\par
list include Washington lawyer Michael Uhlmann , who was passed over\par
for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department , and Marshall Breger ,\par
chairman of a U.S. agency on administration .  The new products allow\par
customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other\par
manufacturers , which `` opens up a phenomenal market for us , '' said\par
Robert J. Paluck , Convex 's chairman , president and chief executive\par
.  Wilson H. Taylor , president and chief executive officer of this\par
insurance and financial services concern , was elected to the\par
additional post of chairman .  The Fed chairman 's caution was\par
apparent again on the Monday morning after the market 's plunge , when\par
the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets .  Cipher\par
Data said Mr. Marinaro consequently has resigned from those posts and\par
from the company 's board .  Most notably , several of the regulatory\par
steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987\par
crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman\par
is now the Treasury secretary .  Mr. Gaubert , who was chairman and\par
the majority stockholder of Independent American , had relinquished\par
his control in exchange for federal regulators ' agreement to drop\par
their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan .  And\par
Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's\par
Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory\par
Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble ,\par
based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . ''\par
Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal\par
position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose\par
large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market\par
emergencies .  And , with no other offers on the table , the board\par
apparently felt no pressure to act on it .  In a statement , Craig\par
O. McCaw , chairman and chief executive officer of McCaw , said : ``\par
We trust LIN will take no further actions that favor BellSouth . ''\par
Meanwhile , in another sign that a new bid is n't imminent , it was\par
learned that the UAL board held a telephone meeting Monday to hear an\par
update on the situation , but that a formal board meeting is n't\par
likely to be convened until early next week .  But the board said it\par
was n't interested for now .  `` The market today has a life of its\par
own , '' John Akers , chairman of International Business Machines\par
Corp. , said Saturday .  Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks\par
continue to lag previous-year rates , leading Eaton to expect\par
fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said\par
Stephen R. Hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and\par
administrative officer .  Michael Henderson , 51-year-old group chief\par
executive of this U.K. metals and industrial materials maker , will\par
become chairman in May , succeeding Ian Butler , 64 , who is retiring\par
.  `` The public did n't come to the market to play a game ; they can\par
go to Off-Track Betting for that , '' says A. Brean Murray , chairman\par
of Brean Murray , Foster Securities , a traditional money management\par
firm .  Program trading itself , according to many academics who have\par
studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly\par
labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace .  The group did\par
n't make a formal offer , but instead told UAL 's advisers before the\par
most-recent board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at\par
between $ 225 and $ 240 a share .  At a later news conference here ,\par
Frank Lorenzo , chairman of Eastern 's parent Texas Air Corp. , said\par
Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and\par
predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors\par
early next year , operating with more service than it originally had\par
scheduled .  Analysts have speculated in recent days that the value of\par
offers received by the committee fell well short of what they had\par
hoped , or even that the company 's chairman , president and chief\par
executive officer , Garth Drabinsky , is the only bidder for the\par
company as a whole .  Robert Pierce , chairman and chief executive of\par
Foothills , said it 's too early to say whether Alaskan or Mackenzie\par
delta gas would flow to market first .  American Physicians said it\par
also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime 's\par
five-member board .  He later resigned from his executive positions\par
with Enfield , saying that actions by its board `` amounted to -LCB-\par
my -RCB- dismissal . ''  Robert G. Walden , 62 years old , was elected\par
a director of this provider of advanced technology systems and\par
services , increasing the board to eight members .  Many analysts\par
expect Mr. Andersson , who owns 1.7 % of the company , to be named\par
Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year .\par
The chairman said his board members , including representatives of\par
West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit\par
Lyonnais and Societe Generale , hold nearly 50 % of Navigation Mixte\par
's capital .  Mr. Hahn , the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive\par
officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is leading the forest-product concern\par
's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp .\par
Jaguar PLC 's chairman said he hopes to reach a friendly pact with\par
General Motors Corp. within a month that may involve the British\par
luxury-car maker 's producing a cheaper executive model .  The\par
takeover-stock traders were hoping that Mr. Davis or one of the other\par
interested parties might re-emerge with the situation in disarray , or\par
that the board might consider a recapitalization .  `` We are reaching\par
the moment of truth '' on Wall Street , said Rep. Edward J. Markey\par
-LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , chairman of the House subcommittee on\par
telecommunications and finance .  As directed by the board , NASA\par
completed the evaluation and again chose CSC .  On the chairman 's\par
motion , the California package was subsequently reduced to\par
less-binding report language , and even when this was accepted as such\par
on a voice vote , Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it .  Among the issues\par
the board will examine is whether United Airlines , a unit of UAL\par
Corp. , should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance\par
checks .  Stuart E. Eizenstat , a partner in the Washington law firm\par
of Powell , Goldstein , Frazer & Murphy , was named a director of this\par
utility holding company , increasing board membership to 14 .  He was\par
on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he\par
insists he made no secret of it .  `` More rooms are n't the answer\par
for us , '' says Caesars World chairman Henry Gluck .  Carl\par
E. Pfeiffer , chief executive officer , was named to the additional\par
post of chairman of this specialty-metals manufacturing concern .\par
Some House Democrats are trying to head off an appointment by\par
President Bush to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout\par
, contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled\par
banks himself .  Shares of Kasler , a California road and bridge\par
builder , were heavily traded , jumping 2 1\\/8 to 9 7\\/8 on 1.3\par
million shares .  `` This ought to be subtitled the ` Do n't let Frank\par
Lorenzo take over another airline ' amendment , '' said Rep. James\par
Oberstar -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , chairman of the House aviation\par
subcommittee , who argued that the provision was unnecessary because\par
the bill already would give the department ample power to block\par
undesirable deals .  `` I 'm not saying everything is hunky-dory , but\par
we have completed the transition , '' Robert M. Price , chairman and\par
chief executive , said in an interview .  Rep. Edward Markey -LRB-\par
D. , Mass. -RRB- , chairman of the House Telecommunications and\par
Finance Subcommittee , is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for\par
computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb `` turmoil ''\par
in the marketplace .  `` We have n't benefited the shareholder as much\par
as we need to , '' said Edgar Woolard Jr. , Du Pont 's chairman and\par
chief executive officer , in an interview several months before he\par
entered his current position in April .  The board said the export\par
licenses would be issued on the condition that Canadian interests\par
would also be allowed to bid for the Mackenzie delta gas on terms\par
similar to those offered to U.S. customers .  The group , led by Giant\par
Group Ltd. and its chairman , Mr. Sugarman , owns about 45.2 % of\par
Rally 's .  Similarly , highway engineers agreed to keep the old\par
railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as they\par
could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road .  He\par
succeeds his father , Philip T. Wilber , who founded the company and\par
remains chairman .  It would also affect the perceptions of the board\par
of governors of the Federal Reserve System , and the informed public\par
generally , as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price\par
stability .  Year-earlier net of $ 21 million , or 84 cents a share ,\par
included the results of Loral 's former Aircraft Braking Systems and\par
Engineered Fabrics divisions , which were sold April 27 to the company\par
's chairman , Bernard L. Schwartz .  Her dismissal angered many in the\par
regional theater establishment and led Peter Zeisler , head of Theatre\par
Communications Group , to write an editorial in American Theatre\par
magazine condemning the board .  Koito has refused to grant\par
Mr. Pickens seats on its board , asserting he is a greenmailer trying\par
to pressure Koito 's other shareholders into buying him out at a\par
profit .  `` Over the summer months , there has been a slowing in the\par
rate of new orders from the computer sector , our primary market , ''\par
said Wilfred J. Corrigan , chairman and chief executive officer .\par
However , Mr. Davis could pressure the board by asking that the\par
agreement be waived , or letting it be known that he has financing for\par
an offer at a lower price .  Seeking a middle path between opponents\par
of change and radicals who demand overnight solutions , the article\par
advocates what it calls a `` radical-moderate approach . ''  The\par
Sept. 30 end of the federal fiscal year may have prodded contractors\par
to get any behind-schedule road and bridge construction under way ``\par
before the clock ran out , '' Mr. Christie said , referring to\par
threatened 5 % across-the-board budget cuts .  Mr. Thompson is\par
believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve\par
the Merc 's tarnished reputation as an exchange whose floor traders do\par
n't follow the rules very well .  And as of last night , Fed Chairman\par
Greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers\par
Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning .  He\par
succeeds Paul J. Montle , 42 , who will remain chairman .  Despite the\par
Composite 's advance , some trading officials are guardedly optimistic\par
that the market is on the road to recovery .  `` What 's encouraging\par
about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their\par

proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank\par
's new shareholding structure .  The pilot union is vowing to pursue\par
an acquisition whatever the board decides .  But a lower bid could\par
face rejection by the UAL board .  Arthur Burns , Federal Reserve\par
Board chairman , said the government 's `` luck '' in keeping the bank\par
open -- despite being the then-biggest U.S. bank failure -- prevented\par
`` shock waves around the country and around the world . ''\par
Separately , the board expanded to six members with the election of\par
David L. Holewinski , a consultant .  Bertin Nadeau , newly appointed\par
chairman and interim chief executive of Provigo , would n't say if\par

out of the stock yesterday .  Domestic lending for real estate and\par
property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's\par
most recent spate of financial troubles , the institution 's executive\par
chairman , Mohamed Basir Ismail , said .  The filing adds a new twist\par
to market speculation that Coniston Partners , a New York money\par
manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the\par
UAL board 's decision last week to remain independent .  The effective\par
date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed\par
until Oct. 1 next year , and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the\par
corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food\par
Research and Action Center .  The company also named Michael\par
E. Gellert , a director and a major shareholder , to fill the vacant\par
seat of chairman .  But to avoid the risk of rejection , the group\par
does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today\par

future . ''  The standard of living has increased steadily over the\par
past 40 years ; more than 90 % of the people consider themselves\par

.  He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of\par

a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill .  CMS ENERGY\par
Corp. said management would recommend to its board today that its\par
common stock dividend be reinstated at a `` modest level '' later this\par
year .  Also , because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL\par
executives have joined the pilots ' bid , the board might be forced to\par
exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other\par
bidders .  The board and UAL 's management , he says , `` ca n't go\par
back '' to business as usual .  William P. Panny , MLX chairman and\par
chief executive , said the pact `` will provide MLX with the\par

purpose of marketing the bonds .  The firm also will permit its\par
members and the public `` to exercise their put and call options\par

may be able gradually to reduce inflation , moving toward the\par

Congress last week .  To suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the\par
middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and\par
shortsighted .  `` It 's pretty much weak across the board , '' said\par
Martin Regalia , chief economist of the National Council of Savings\par
Institutions .  He said that when he was on the board he felt that he\par

good thing .  -LRB- Opposed by new SEC chairman -RRB- And statements\par
by the chairman of the IG Metall labor union , Franz Steinkuehler ,\par
